  <title>Number Systems</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In this chapter we discuss the algebraic structure of the rational, 
        real, and complex numbers, as well as look at some various representations 
        and models for these number systems. While you should be intimately 
        familiar with each of these number systems, we will look at each from 
        various points of view to ensure a solid understanding of their properties 
        and structure. </p>
